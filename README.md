### General purpose:
Create an application to help find matching collaborators in github.
Trough github crawling and relationship modelling.
The user should be able to find and identify potential collaborators or projects related to a specific topic.

### Why:
It is indeed very hard and time consuming to find people in github that match your interests or projects you like to work on.
This project is trying to solve that problem in a user friendly way.
### Roadmap:
- #### Github crawler (scrapy/python):
Github.com crawler using scrapy framework.
- #### Backend (node/neo4j):
Database to model the relationships between contributors and repos.
With an api to model it.
The api would model it. 
- #### UI (Vue.js)
Main use case is to search repos and contributors by topic.

- ### NLU and topic modeling.
Finding projects/issues/contributors that would best match a certain topic/subject.
